I couldn't find an `=' or `:=' after the
expression that is shown above this error message,
so I guess I'll just ignore it and carry on.

I've just read as much of that statement as I could fathom,
so a semicolon should have been next. It's very puzzling...
but I'll try to get myself back together, by ignoring
everything up to the next `;'. Please insert a semicolon
now in front of anything that you don't want me to delete.
(See Chapter 27 of The METAFONTbook for an example.)

The next thing in this loop should have been `=' or `:='.
But don't worry; I'll pretend that an equals sign
was present, and I'll look for the values next.

The next thing in this loop should have been a `:'.
So I'll pretend that a colon was present;
everything from here to `endfor' will be iterated.

I suspect you have forgotten an `endfor',
causing me to read past where you wanted me to stop.
I'll try to recover; but if the error is serious,
you'd better type `E' or `X' now and fix your file.
