You are analyzing activation patterns from clusters of latents from a sparse autoencoder (SAE) trained on the
residual stream at layer 20 in Gemma-2-9B. We selected a small number of clusters where it looked most plausible
that the portion of the residual space covered by the latents in the cluster was being leveraged by the model to
represent the current belief state across a state space.

CONTEXT:
We identified clusters of SAE features geometrically, combining two versions of k-subspace clustering to cluster the
decoder vectors for each latent. For each cluster, we ran samples from the FineWeb dataset. For examples where any latent
from the cluster fired, we projected the latent vector back into residual space only considering the latents from the
cluster of interest, zeroing out all latents from other clusters. This gave us a cluster-example specific
representation. We used these cluster-example projections as training examples to fit an Archetypal Analysis Network
(AANet). This is an autoencoder that projects cluster activations onto a (k-1)-dimension probability simplex with k
vertices at the bottleneck before trying to recreate the input vector.

SIMPLEX GEOMETRY:
- Points on a k-vertex simplex are probability distributions over k outcomes
- Vertices represent "pure" or "extreme" states
- Interior points are weighted mixtures (convex combinations) of vertices
- Example: On a 3-vertex simplex, point (0.7, 0.2, 0.1) means we believe there's currently a 70% chance we're in
  state 0, a 20% chance we're in state 1, and a 10% probability we're in state 2"

WHY THIS MATTERS:
If the model represents belief states as simplices, this reveals what alternatives it's tracking probabilities over.

YOUR TASK:
We will provide you with text examples that activate the hidden simplex layer in the AAnet very close to a vertex.
This means that we believe that the model is storing a belief about the state space that is nearly certain about
the current value of the hidden state being tracked. We will provide examples for each vertex. Our goal is to
determine:
1. What latent state or class each vertex represents
2. What decision space or belief distribution this simplex encodes
3. Confidence in this interpretation

ANALYSIS GUIDELINES:
- Look for latents or abstract patterns across multiple samples per vertex
- The latents could be linguistic: tense, modality, sentiment, entity types, discourse structure, etc.
- The latents could be about facts, like what country or city or ethnicity is being discussed
- The latents could be abstract, like the tenor or stance of the text: truthful, lying, hostile, dissembling,
  helpful, sycophantic, etc.
- The kind of state or class the latents represent are not limited to the above examples
- Ensure vertex labels form a coherent set (e.g., all temporal, all sentiment-based)
- Think about what a mixture would mean (e.g., "uncertain between past and future", or "uncertain between truthful
  and lying")
- Be specific: "past tense verbs" not "temporal stuff"
- In each example, the word(s) where the cluster's latents actually fired are wrapped in <trigger>...</trigger>
  tags. Focus your interpretation on THESE specific words and their immediate context. Do not interpret the
  overall topic of the passage — interpret what is happening at the trigger word(s), using the surrounding text
  only for context.

EXAMPLES OF GOOD INTERPRETATIONS:
- State space: "Temporal reference for verb tense"
  Vertices: ["Past tense/completed actions", "Present tense/ongoing", "Future tense/planned"]

- State space: "Modality and certainty"
  Vertices: ["Definite/factual statements", "Possible/hypothetical", "Counterfactual/contrary-to-fact"]

- State space: "Argument structure roles"
  Vertices: ["Agent/subject position", "Patient/object position", "Location/setting", "Instrument/means"]
