You are analyzing activation patterns from clusters of latents from a sparse autoencoder (SAE) trained on the
residual stream at layer 20 in Gemma-2-9B. We selected a small number of clusters where it looked most plausible
that the portion of the residual space covered by the latents in the cluster was being leveraged by the model to
represent the current belief state across a state space.

CONTEXT:
We identified clusters of SAE features geometrically, combining two versions of k-subspace clustering to cluster the
decoder vectors for each latent. For each cluster, we ran samples from the Pile dataset. For examples where any latent
from the cluster fired, we projected the latent vector back into residual space only considering the latents from the
cluster of interest, zeroing out all latents from other clusters. This gave us a cluster-example specific
representation. We used these cluster-example projections as training examples to fit an Archetypal Analysis Network
(AANet). This is an autoencoder that projects cluster activations onto a (k-1)-dimension probability simplex with k
vertices at the bottleneck before trying to recreate the input vector.

SIMPLEX GEOMETRY:
- Points on a k-vertex simplex are probability distributions over k outcomes
- Vertices represent "pure" or "extreme" states
- Interior points are weighted mixtures (convex combinations) of vertices
- Example: On a 3-vertex simplex, point (0.7, 0.2, 0.1) means we believe there's currently a 70% chance we're in
  state 0, a 20% chance we're in state 1, and a 10% probability we're in state 2"

WHY THIS MATTERS:
If the model represents belief states as simplices, this reveals what alternatives it's tracking probabilities over.

YOUR TASK:
We will provide you with text examples that activate the hidden simplex layer in the AAnet very close to one of the
vertices. This means that we believe that the model is storing a belief about the state space that is nearly certain
that the current value of the hidden state being tracked is the one associated with the vertex under consideration.
We will provide examples for this vertex. Our goal is to determine:
1. What latent state or class the vertex represents
2. Confidence in this interpretation

ANALYSIS GUIDELINES:
- Look for latents or abstract patterns across multiple samples from the vertex
- The latent could be linguistic: tense, modality, sentiment, entity types, discourse structure, etc.
- The latent could be about facts, like what country or city or ethnicity is being discussed
- The latent could be abstract, like the tenor or stance of the text: truthful, lying, hostile, dissembling,
  helpful, sycophantic, etc.
- The kind of state or class the latents represent are not limited to the above examples
- Be specific: "past tense verbs" not "temporal stuff"
- Provide two proposals for the latent represented by the vertex
- At the beginning of each example we will share the words (and their position in the text) where the vertex in
  question was active. Remember not to try to interpret the whole example. Interpret the word(s) where the vertex
  was active, using the rest of the test to better understand the context and meaning of the given word(s)

EXAMPLES OF GOOD INTERPRETATIONS:
- "Past tense/completed actions"
- "Possible/hypothetical statements"
- "Agent/subject position"
