You are analyzing activation patterns from clusters of latents from a sparse autoencoder (SAE) trained on the
residual stream at layer 20 in Gemma-2-9B. We selected a small number of clusters where it looked most plausible
that the portion of the residual space covered by the latents in the cluster was being leveraged by the model to
represent the current belief state across a state space.

CONTEXT:
We identified clusters of SAE features geometrically, combining two versions of k-subspace clustering to cluster the
decoder vectors for each latent. For each cluster, we ran samples from the Pile dataset. For examples where any latent
from the cluster fired, we projected the latent vector back into residual space only considering the latents from the
cluster of interest, zeroing out all latents from other clusters. This gave us a cluster-example specific
representation. We used these cluster-example projections as training examples to fit an Archetypal Analysis Network
(AANet). This is an autoencoder that projects cluster activations onto a (k-1)-dimension probability simplex with k
vertices at the bottleneck before trying to recreate the input vector.

SIMPLEX GEOMETRY:
- Points on a k-vertex simplex are probability distributions over k outcomes
- Vertices represent "pure" or "extreme" states
- Interior points are weighted mixtures (convex combinations) of vertices
- Example: On a 3-vertex simplex, point (0.7, 0.2, 0.1) means we believe there's currently a 70% chance we're in
  state 0, a 20% chance we're in state 1, and a 10% probability we're in state 2"

WHY THIS MATTERS:
If the model represents belief states as simplices, this reveals what alternatives it's tracking probabilities over.

YOUR TASK:
We have already taken samples where the projection into the simplex in the bottleneck of the AAnet results in points
very close to the vertices. We have done this over a number of iterations, one vertex at a time. Each iteration, we
generated two proposals for what latent state was represented by the vertex under consideration. We will provide you
the set of proposals we have generated for each vertex. Our goal is to determine:
1. The most likely description of the total state space
2. The set of latent states represented by the vertices, one per vertex
3. Confidence in this interpretation

ANALYSIS GUIDELINES:
- The latent could be linguistic: tense, modality, sentiment, entity types, discourse structure, etc.
- The latent could be about facts, like what country or city or ethnicity is being discussed
- The latent could be abstract, like the tenor or stance of the text: truthful, lying, hostile, dissembling,
  helpful, sycophantic, etc.
- The kind of state or class the latents represent are not limited to the above examples
- Be specific: "past tense verbs" not "temporal stuff"
- Provide two proposals for the latent represented by the vertex

EXAMPLES OF GOOD INTERPRETATIONS:
- State space: "Temporal reference for verb tense"
  Vertices: ["Past tense/completed actions", "Present tense/ongoing", "Future tense/planned"]

- State space: "Modality and certainty"
  Vertices: ["Definite/factual statements", "Possible/hypothetical", "Counterfactual/contrary-to-fact"]

- State space: "Argument structure roles"
  Vertices: ["Agent/subject position", "Patient/object position", "Location/setting", "Instrument/means"]

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Output ONLY valid JSON (no markdown, no code fences, no extra text)
- Include all required fields
- Be concise but specific in labels
- Because we have proposed latent states for each vertex independently, there may be no plausible state space. If
  this is the case, make your best guess and make sure to note low confidence. Also, note that this is a guess and
  the independent proposals don't combine well into a sensible state space in the reasoning field.
