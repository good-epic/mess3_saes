You are analyzing SAE activation patterns from Gemma-2-9B.

TASK: These text samples activate near different vertices of a probability simplex. Vertices represent "pure states" and interior points are probability distributions over these states.

Analyze the samples and identify:
1. What semantic pattern each vertex represents
2. What belief state or decision space the simplex encodes

REQUIREMENTS:
- Output ONLY valid JSON (no markdown, no extra text)
- Be specific and concrete
- Ensure vertex labels are at the same abstraction level

OUTPUT FORMAT:
{
  "state_space_hypothesis": "What this simplex represents",
  "vertex_labels": ["Vertex 0 label", "Vertex 1 label", ...],
  "confidence": "high|medium|low",
  "reasoning": "Brief explanation with evidence"
}
