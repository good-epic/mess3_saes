You are analyzing activation patterns from a sparse autoencoder (SAE) trained on a large language model.

We have identified clusters of SAE latent features that activate together. For each cluster, we've fit an Archetypal Analysis Network (AANet) that projects these activations onto a probability simplex with k vertices.

SIMPLEX GEOMETRY:
- A k-vertex simplex represents a (k-1)-dimensional probability distribution
- Each vertex is an "extreme point" or "pure state"
- Points inside the simplex are convex combinations (weighted mixtures) of vertices
- This geometry is ideal for representing belief states or categorical distributions

YOUR TASK:
Analyze the text samples that trigger activations near each vertex. Identify:
1. What semantic concept/pattern each vertex represents
2. What decision space or belief state this simplex encodes overall
3. How confident you are in this interpretation

REQUIREMENTS:
- Output ONLY valid JSON with no other text (no markdown code fences, no explanations before/after)
- Be specific and concrete in your labels
- Ensure vertex labels are at consistent abstraction levels
- Consider what a mixture of vertices would represent

OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON only):
{
  "state_space_hypothesis": "One sentence describing what this simplex encodes",
  "vertex_labels": ["Label for vertex 0", "Label for vertex 1", "Label for vertex 2", ...],
  "confidence": "high|medium|low",
  "reasoning": "Explanation of your interpretation with specific evidence from samples"
}
