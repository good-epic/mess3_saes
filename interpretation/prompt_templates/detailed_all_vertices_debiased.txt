You are analyzing activation patterns from clusters of latents from a sparse autoencoder (SAE) trained on the
residual stream at layer 20 in Gemma-2-9B.

CONTEXT:
We identified clusters of SAE features geometrically, combining two versions of k-subspace clustering to cluster the
decoder vectors for each latent. For each cluster, we ran samples from the FineWeb dataset. For examples where any latent
from the cluster fired, we projected the latent vector back into residual space only considering the latents from the
cluster of interest, zeroing out all latents from other clusters. This gave us a cluster-example specific
representation. We used these cluster-example projections as training examples to fit an Archetypal Analysis Network
(AANet). This is an autoencoder that projects cluster activations onto a (k-1)-dimension probability simplex with k
vertices at the bottleneck before trying to recreate the input vector.

SIMPLEX GEOMETRY:
- Points on a k-vertex simplex can be expressed as coordinates summing to 1
- Vertices represent "pure" or "extreme" activation patterns for the cluster
- Interior points are weighted mixtures (convex combinations) of vertices
- Example: On a 3-vertex simplex, point (0.7, 0.2, 0.1) means the activation is mostly like vertex 0,
  with some similarity to vertex 1 and a little to vertex 2

WHY THIS MATTERS:
The simplex structure means the cluster's activation patterns decompose into a small number of archetypal patterns
(vertices), and every activation is a mixture of these. We want to understand what distinguishes each archetype.

YOUR TASK:
We will provide you with text examples where the cluster's activations project very close to a particular vertex.
These are cases where the cluster's activation pattern strongly resembles one specific archetype. We will provide
examples for each vertex. Our goal is to determine:
1. What distinguishes the text examples at each vertex from those at other vertices
2. What dimension of variation the simplex captures overall
3. Confidence in this interpretation

ANALYSIS GUIDELINES:
- Look for concrete patterns across multiple samples per vertex
- Consider all possibilities. The vertices could distinguish:
  - Syntactic features: part of speech, clause type, grammatical role, sentence position
  - Semantic categories: entity types, topic domains, concrete vs. abstract, animate vs. inanimate
  - Discourse structure: paragraph openings, transitions, conclusions, dialogue vs. narration
  - Register or style: formal vs. informal, technical vs. conversational, literary vs. expository
  - Factual content: geographic regions, time periods, domains of knowledge
  - Pragmatic function: assertions, questions, commands, hedging
  - Any other dimension -- these are just examples, not an exhaustive list
- Ensure vertex labels form a coherent set of contrasts along a single dimension
- Think about what intermediate points would mean (e.g., "partly narrative, partly expository")
- Be specific: "past tense action verbs" not "temporal stuff"
- In each example, the word(s) where the cluster's latents actually fired are wrapped in <trigger>...</trigger>
  tags. Focus your interpretation on THESE specific words and their immediate context. Do not interpret the
  overall topic of the passage — interpret what is happening at the trigger word(s), using the surrounding text
  only for context.

EXAMPLES OF GOOD INTERPRETATIONS:
- Dimension: "Verb tense at trigger position"
  Vertices: ["Past tense/completed actions", "Present tense/ongoing", "Future tense/planned"]

- Dimension: "Named entity type"
  Vertices: ["Person names", "Organization/institution names", "Geographic locations", "Dates/time expressions"]

- Dimension: "Discourse function of sentence"
  Vertices: ["Introducing new information/topic", "Elaborating on previous claim", "Contrasting or qualifying"]

- Dimension: "Text register"
  Vertices: ["Technical/scientific prose", "Conversational/informal", "Narrative/storytelling", "Legal/bureaucratic"]
